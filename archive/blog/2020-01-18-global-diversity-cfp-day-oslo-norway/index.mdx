What is CFP?
------------

*   A lot of conferences will require you to submit a Call for Papers, or CFP.
*   Usually CFP is just a paragraph or two for your talk abstract, a paragraph or two directly to the conference organizers, and then maybe special things like your Social Media Network handle.

*   To choose Topics
    
    *   Think about

    *   What fears you / What makes you sad
    *   The Ahaa moment

    *   Know you audience, What they expect
    *   Try not to overestimate the level of expectations from your audience
    *   Nothing is too easy for any audience (there are mixed audience)
    *   Level your session properly
        
        *   Beginner
        *   Intermediate (Target your talks in this area)
        *   Expert

    *   Being an expert is not important
    *   Don’t be afraid to fail
    *   There can always be an expert attending your talk
        
        *   Don’t let that bother you
    *   Answering to audience
        
        *   Listen the question properly, repeat to make sure you are answering correct question or you understand the correct question. This has a lot of benefits
        *   Be frank if you don’t know the answer

        *   Make sure you are not offensive
        *   Your personal experience on a topic makes it your talk

How to submit the proposal ?
----------------------------

*   Put your efforts in this, there are no shortcuts
*   Read and update
*   Don’t mix topics
*   People love stories, what you messed up, how you fixed things
*   The Title
    
    *   Very Important
    *   Eye Catching
    *   Sets the expectation
    *   You need to deliver on your topic
    *   Convince your audience that the talk is gonna be worth their time
    *   Title starting with name for framework sometimes work
*   The small abstract
    
    *   Language is important
    *   Should be easy to understand
    *   Event specific abstract is useful
    *   Structure it properly
    *   What problem you will solve
    *   How you will solve that problem
*   Ask for feedback, to work upon if your proposal gets rejected
    
    *   Sometimes you may not get the feedback or the feedback can be very generic
*   Some conf also provide speaker training
*   Sometimes conferences enforce templates
    
    *   Example Title slides
    *   You can be flexible with it
    *   if you are not comfortable politely reject this
    *   What you present is your property, you own it
    *   Title slide sets the moods

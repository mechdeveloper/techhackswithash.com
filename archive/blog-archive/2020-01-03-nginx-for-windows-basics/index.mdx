Download and run
----------------

[download](http://nginx.org/en/download.html) the latest mainline version distribution and run `nginx`, Here is an example for the drive C: root directory:

    cd c:\
    unzip nginx-1.17.7.zip
    cd nginx-1.17.7
    start nginx

Run the tasklist command-line utility to see nginx processes:

    C:\nginx-1.17.7>tasklist /fi "imagename eq nginx.exe"
    
    Image Name           PID Session Name     Session#    Mem Usage
    =============== ======== ============== ========== ============
    nginx.exe            652 Console                 0      2 780 K
    nginx.exe           1332 Console                 0      3 112 K

One of the processes is the master process and another is the worker process. If nginx does not start, look for the reason in the error log file logs\\error.log.

nginx/Windows runs as a standard console application (not a service), and it can be managed using the following commands:

    # fast shutdown
    nginx -s stop
    
    # graceful shutdown
    nginx -s quit
    
    # changing configuration, starting new worker processes with a new configuration, graceful shutdown of old worker processes
    nginx -s reload
    
    # re-opening log files
    nginx -s reopen

nginx/Windows uses the directory where it has been run as the prefix for relative paths in the configuration.

In the example above, the prefix is C:\\nginx-1.17.7. Paths in a configuration file must be specified in UNIX-style using forward slashes:

    access_log   logs/site.log;
    root         C:/web/html;

nginx.conf
----------

*   nginx consists of **modules** which are controlled by **directives** specified in the **configuration file**
*   **directives** are divided into simple directives (ends with `;`) and block directives (surrounded by { and }).
*   If a block directive can have other directives inside braces, it is called a context (examples: events, http, server and location)
*   Directives placed in the configuration file outside of any contexts are considered to be in the main context. The `events` and `http` directives reside in the main context, `server` in `http`, and `location` in `server`.

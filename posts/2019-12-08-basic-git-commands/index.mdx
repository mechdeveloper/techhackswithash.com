# Basic git commands

## git config

Configure your identity

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

Configure Proxy

```bash
git config --global --add http.proxy http://proxy.domain.com:80/
git config --global --add https.proxy http://proxy.domain.com:80/
```

Unset Git config

```bash
git config --global --unset https.proxy
git config --global --unset http.proxy
```

Checking your config settings

```bash
git config --list

git config global --list
git config system --list
git config local --list
```

Checking specific key’s value in your config settings

```bash
git config <key>
git config user.name
```

## 1\. git help

Getting Help

```bash
git help <verb>
git <verb> --help
man git-<verb>

git help config
```

## 2\. git clone

clone an existing git repository.

```bash
git clone <remote-repository-url>
git clone <remote-repository-url> <custom-folder-name>

git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
```

clone a specific branch. Using the `-b` option, you are fetching all the branches but you are checking out the branch you chose.

```bash
git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>
git clone -b dev https://github.com/username/project.git
```

## 3\. git init


initialize a git repository

```bash
git init
```

## 4\. git status

Checking the Status of Your Files

```bash
git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

## 5\. git add
-----------

Tracking new files or staging modified files

```bash
git add <file-name>
```

To stage all modified files / track all new files

```bash
git add .
```

Ignoring files
--------------

in git repository `.gitignore` file

The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:

*   Blank lines or lines starting with `#` are ignored.
*   Standard glob patterns work.
*   You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.
*   You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!). Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use.
*   An asterisk (\*) matches zero or more characters;
*   \[abc\] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c);
*   a question mark (?) matches a single character; and
*   brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen(\[0-9\]) matches any character in the range (in this case 0 through 9) .

Here is an example `.gitignore` file:

```txt 
# a comment - this is ignored
# no .a files
*.a
# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a
# only ignore the root TODO file, not subdir/TODO
/TODO
# ignore all files in the build/ directory
build/
# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt
# ignore all .txt files in the doc/ directory
doc/**/*.txt
A **/ pattern is available in Git since version 1.8.2.
```

## 6\. git commit

commit your changes to git repository

```bash
git commit -m "Story 182: Fix benchmarks for speed"
```

Skip staging area by using `-a` option to the `git commit` command, this will make Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip the `git add` part

```bash
git commit -a -m 'added new benchmarks'
```

## 7\. git rm

Removing Files from Git. `git rm` removes file from working directory

```bash
git rm <file-name>
git rm PROJECTS.md
```

## 8\. git mv

Moving Files. To rename a file in Git, you can run

```bash
git mv <file-from> <file-to>
git mv README.md README
```

## 9\. git diff

To see what you have changed but not yet staged

```bash 
git diff 
```

To see what you have staged that will go into your next commit

```bash 
git diff --cached (or git diff --staged)
```

diff between the tips of the two branches

```bash 
git diff branch_1..branch_2
```

to find the diff from their common ancestor to test, you can use three dots instead of two - Git now compares the tip of our feature branch with the common ancestor commit of both branches

```bash 
git diff branch_1...branch_2
```

And if you just want to check which files differ, not how the content differs. Use this:

```bash
git diff --name-only branch_1...branch_2
```

## 10\. git log

Viewing the commit history.

```bash 
git log
git log -p -2
git log --stat
git log --pretty=oneline
git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph
git log --since=2.weeks
git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
```

## 11\. git remote

Working with Remotes. Manage remote repositories.

Showing Your Remotes.

> Note: `git clone` command implicitly adds the origin remote for you. 

```bash 
git remote
origin

git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
```

Adding Remote Repositories.

To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily

```bash
git remote add <shortname> <url>
git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
```

Inspecting a Remote. use the following command to see more information about a particular remote

```bash
git remote show <remote>
git remote show origin
```

Renaming Removing Remotes 

Following command will rename the `pb` remote to `paul`. this changes all your remote-tracking branch names, too. `pb/master` is now `paul/master`

```bash 
git remote rename pb paul
```

To remove a remote use following command

```bash 
git remote remove paul
git remote rm paul
```

## 12\. git fetch

Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes. To get data from your remote project you can run

```bash
git fetch <remote>
git fetch origin
```

> Note: `git fetch` command only downloads the data to your local repository - it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.

## 13\. git pull

`git pull` command is used to automatically fetch and then merge the remote branch into your current branch. Running `git pull` generally fetches data from server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you’re currently working on.

```bash
git pull
```

14\. git push

Pushing to Your Remotes. push committed changes in local repository up to remote repository.

```bash
git push

git push <remote> <branch>
git push origin master
```

Share changes (this will create branchname on remote repo if it doesn’t exist)

```bash
git push origin
```

Push a new local branch to a remote git repository and track it too (`-u` option tells git to start tracking local branch to branchname from origin) After this one time setup of tracking information `git push` can be directly used to share updates quickly and easily

```bash
git push -u origin feature_branch_name
```

## 15\. git tag

Tagging

Listing Your Tags. Listing tag wildcards requires `-l` or `--list` option

```bash 
git tag
git tag -l "v1.8.5*"
```

Annotated Tags

```bash 
git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"
```

Lightweight Tags

```bash 
git tag v1.4-lw
```

To see tag information

```bash
git show v1.4
git show 1.4-lw
```

Tagging Later

```bash 
git tag -a <tag-name> <commit-hash>
git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02
```

Sharing Tags

```bash
git push origin v1.5
git push origin --tags
```

Deleting Tags

```bash 
git tag -d v1.4-lw
```

To delete a remote tag

```bash
git push origin --delete <tagname>
git push origin --delete v1.4-lw 
```

Checkout Tags

```bash 
git checkout v2.0.0
git checkout -b version2 v2.0.0
```

## 16\. git branch

Branch Management

List your current branches

```bash 
git branch
```

To see last commit on each branch

```bash 
git branch -v
```

The useful `--merged` and `--no-merged` options can filter the list of branches that you have not yet merged into the branch you’re currently on.

```bash 
git branch --merged
git branch --no-merged
```

Create a new branch

```bash 
git branch test
```

If a branch exists on the remote repository, but not on your local repo, you can simply use `git switch`. Note that if remote branch doesn’t exist locally you’ll need to `git fetch` first before using switch.

```bash
git fetch 

git switch <remote-repo-branch>
git switch dev
```

Delete a branch
```bash
git branch -d hotfix
```

Delete a branch from remote repo

```bash
git branch -a
git push origin --delete hotfix
```

Delete an un-merged branch or delete a branch and lose the work

```bash
git branch -D testing
```

## 17\. git checkout

Switching Branches

```bash
git checkout test
```

Creating a new branch and switching to it at the same time

```bash
git checkout -b <newbranchname>
git checkout -b dev 
```

## 18\. git merge

merge branch to checked out branch

```bash 
git checkout master
git merge hotfix
```

## 19\. git rebase

Reapply commits on top of another base tip

Assume the following history exists and the current branch is "topic":
```
    A---B---C topic
    /
D---E---F---G master
```

From this point, the result of either of the following commands:
```bash 
git rebase master
git rebase master topic
```

would be:
```
            A'--B'--C' topic
            /
D---E---F---G master
```

> NOTE: The latter form is just a short-hand of `git checkout topic` followed by `git rebase master`. When rebase exits topic will remain the checked-out branch.

After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with the desired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process with

```bash 
git rebase --continue
```

You can undo `git rebase` with

```bash 
git rebase --abort
```

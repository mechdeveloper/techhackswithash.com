# Basic git commands

<YouTube id="o5kMU9ykFKY" />

git config
----------

### Your Identity

```bash
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```

### Configure Proxy

    ```bash
    git config --global --add http.proxy http://proxy.domain.com:80/
    git config --global --add https.proxy http://proxy.domain.com:80/
    ```

### Unset Git config

    ```bash
    git config --global --unset https.proxy
    git config --global --unset http.proxy
    ```

### Checking your settings

    ```bash
    git config --list
    
    git config global --list
    git config system --list
    git config local --list
    ```

### Checking specific key’s value

in your config settings

    ```bash
    git config <key>
    git config user.name
    ```

1\. git help
------------

Getting Help

    ```bash
    git help <verb>
    git <verb> --help
    man git-<verb>
    
    git help config
    ```

2\. git clone
-------------

clone an existing git repository.

    ```bash
    git clone <remote-repository-url>
    git clone <remote-repository-url> <custom-folder-name>
    
    git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
    ```

clone a specific branch. Using the `-b` option, you are fetching all the branches but you are checking out the branch you chose.

    ```bash
    git clone -b <branch> <remote_repo>
    git clone -b dev https://github.com/username/project.git
    ```

3\. git init
------------

initialize a git repository

    git init

4\. git status
--------------

Checking the Status of Your Files

    ```bash
    git status
    On branch master
    Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
    nothing to commit, working directory clean
    ```

5\. git add
-----------

Tracking New Files or Staging Modified files

    ```bash
    git add <file-name>
    ```

To stage all modified files / track all new files

    git add .

6\. git commit
--------------

commit your changes to git repository

    git commit -m "Story 182: Fix benchmarks for speed"

Skip staging area by using `-a` option to the `git commit` command, this will make Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip the `git add` part

    git commit -a -m 'added new benchmarks'

7\. git rm
----------

Removing Files from Git. `git rm` removes file from working directory

    ```bash
    git rm <file-name>
    git rm PROJECTS.md
    ```

8\. git mv
----------

Moving Files. To rename a file in Git, you can run

    ```bash
    git mv <file-from> <file-to>
    git mv README.md README
    ```

Ignoring files
--------------

in git repository .gitignore file

The rules for the patterns you can put in the .gitignore file are as follows:

*   Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored.
*   Standard glob patterns work.
*   You can end patterns with a forward slash (/) to specify a directory.
*   You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (!). Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use.
*   An asterisk (\*) matches zero or more characters;
*   \[abc\] matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c);
*   a question mark (?) matches a single character; and
*   brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen(\[0-9\]) matches any character in the range (in this case 0 through 9) .

Here is an example .gitignore file:

    # a comment - this is ignored
    # no .a files
    *.a
    # but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
    !lib.a
    # only ignore the root TODO file, not subdir/TODO
    /TODO
    # ignore all files in the build/ directory
    build/
    # ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
    doc/*.txt
    # ignore all .txt files in the doc/ directory
    doc/**/*.txt
    A **/ pattern is available in Git since version 1.8.2.

9\. git diff
------------

To see what you have changed but not yet staged

    git diff 

To see what you have staged that will go into your next commit

    git diff --cached (or git diff --staged)

diff between the tips of the two branches

    git diff branch_1..branch_2

to find the diff from their common ancestor to test, you can use three dots instead of two Git now compares the tip of our feature branch with the common ancestor commit of both branches

    git diff branch_1...branch_2

And if you just want to check which files differ, not how the content differs. Use this:

    git diff --name-only branch_1...branch_2

10\. git log
------------

Viewing the Commit History.

    git log
    git log -p -2
    git log --stat
    git log --pretty=oneline
    git log --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
    git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" --graph
    git log --since=2.weeks
    git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all

11\. git remote
---------------

Working with Remotes. Manage remote repositories.

Showing Your Remotes.

    git remote
    origin
    git remote -v
    origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
    origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)

Adding Remote Repositories.

> Note: `git clone` command implicitly adds the origin remote for you. To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily

    ```bash
    git remote add <shortname> <url>
    git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
    ```

Inspecting a Remote. use the following command to see more information about a particular remote

    ```bash
    git remote show <remote>
    git remote show origin
    ```

Renaming Removing Remotes Following command will rename the pb remote to paul. this changes all your remote-tracking branch names, too. pb/master is now paul/master

    git remote rename pb paul

To remove a remote use following command

    git remote remove paul
    git remote rm paul

12\. git fetch
--------------

Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes. To get data from your remote project you can run

    ```bash
    git fetch <remote>
    git fetch origin
    ```

> Note: `git fetch` command only downloads the data to your local repository - it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.

13\. git pull
-------------

`git pull` command is used to automatically fetch and then merge the remote branch into your current branch. Running `git pull` generally fetches data from server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you’re currently working on.

    git pull

14\. git push
-------------

Pushing to Your Remotes. push committed changes in local repository up to remote repository.

    ```bash
    git push
    git push <remote> <branch>
    git push origin master
    ```

Share changes (this will create branchname on remote repo if it doesn’t exist)

    git push origin

Push a new local branch to a remote git repository and track it too (-u option tells git to start tracking local branch to branchname from origin) After this one time setup of tracking information git push can be directly used to share updates quickly and easily

    git push -u origin feature_branch_name

15\. git tag
------------

Tagging.

Listing Your Tags. Listing tag wildcards requires `-l` or `--list` option

    git tag
    git tag -l "v1.8.5*"

Annotated Tags

    git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"

Lightweight Tags

    git tag v1.4-lw

To see tag information

    git show v1.4
    git show 1.4-lw

Tagging Later

    ```bash 
    git tag -a <tag-name> <commit-hash>
    git tag -a v1.2 9fceb02
    ```

Sharing Tags

    git push origin v1.5
    git push origin --tags

Deleting Tags

    git tag -d v1.4-lw

To delete a remote tag

    ```bash
    git push origin --delete <tagname>
    ```

Checkout Tags

    git checkout v2.0.0
    git checkout -b version2 v2.0.0

16\. git branch
---------------

Branch Management.

List your current branches

    git branch

To see last commit on each branch

    git branch -v

The useful `--merged` and `--no-merged` options can filter the list of branches that you have not yet merged into the branch you’re currently on.

    git branch --merged
    git branch --no-merged

Create a new branch

    git branch testing

If a branch exists on the remote repository, but not on your local repo, you can simply use git switch. Note that if remote branch doesn’t exist locally you’ll need to git fetch first before using switch.

    ```bash
    git switch <remote-repo-branch>
    ```

Delete a branch

    git branch -d hotfix

Delete a branch from remote repo

    git branch -a
    git push origin --delete hotfix

Delete an un-merged branch or delete a branch and lose the work

    git branch -D testing

17\. git checkout
-----------------

Switching Branches

    git checkout testing

Creating a new branch and switching to it at the same time

    ```bash
    git checkout -b <newbranchname>
    ```

18\. git merge
--------------

merge branch to checked out branch

    git checkout master
    git merge hotfix

19\. git rebase
---------------

to maintain topic branches

              A---B---C topic
             /
        D---E---F---G master

    git rebase master
    git rebase master topic

                      A'--B'--C' topic
                     /
        D---E---F---G master

> NOTE: The latter form is just a short-hand of git checkout topic followed by git rebase master. When rebase exits topic will remain the checked-out branch.

After resolving the conflict manually and updating the index with the desired resolution, you can continue the rebasing process with

    git rebase --continue

You can undo `git rebase` with

    git rebase --abort

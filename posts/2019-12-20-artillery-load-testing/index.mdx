Artillery
=========

[Official Website](https://artillery.io/docs/)

Install Artillery
-----------------
    
```bash
npm install -g artillery
```

To check that the installation succeeded, run:
    
```bash
artillery -V
```

You can try `artillery dino` too.

Run a quick test
----------------

```bash
artillery quick --count 10 -n 20 https://artillery.io/
```

`artillery quick` is used for ad-hoc testing. Above command will create 10 virutal users each of which will send 20 HTTP requests to [https://artillery.io/](https://artillery.io/). use -k to ignore certificate errors. -o .json to extract test results in JSON file.

Run a test script
-----------------

You write your load testing scripts and tell Artillery to run them. Scripts are written in YAML, with the option to write JavaScript to write custom logic.

### Run a test script and generate report

```bash 
artillery run -o <report_name>.json <test_file>.yml
```

### Convert the above generated report to HTML

```bash 
artillery report <report_name>.json
```

### Putting A Test Script Together

load testing scripts have two main parts - `config` and `scenarios`

`config` section

*   specify **target** (such as address of the API server under test)
*   **load progression** (telling artillery for eg. to create 20 virtual users every second for 10 minutes)
*   can set a variety of other options such as HTTP timeout settings, or TLS settings

`scenarios` section

*   here you define what virtual users created by Artillery will be doing

Copy following code into a `test.yml` file:

```YAML
config:
  target: "https://staging1.local"
  phases:
    - duration: 60
      arrivalRate: 5
    - duration: 120
      arrivalRate: 5
      rampTo: 50
    - duration: 600
      arrivalRate: 50
  payload:
    path: "keywords.csv"
    fields:
      - "keywords"
scenarios:
  - name: "Search and buy"
    flow:
      - post:
          url: "/search"
          body: "kw={{ keywords }}"
          capture:
            json: "$.results[0].id"
            as: "id"
      - get:
          url: "/details/{{ id }}"
      - think: 3
      - post:
          url: "/cart"
          json:
            productId: "{{ id }}"
```

### Running the test

```bash
artillery run test.yml
```

Test report will look similar to this:

```bash
Complete report @ 2019-01-02T17:32:36.653Z
  Scenarios launched:  300
  Scenarios completed: 300
  Requests completed:  600
  RPS sent: 18.86
  Request latency:
    min: 52.1
    max: 11005.7
    median: 408.2
    p95: 1727.4
    p99: 3144
  Scenario counts:
    0: 300 (100%)
  Codes:
    200: 300
    302: 300
```
    
*   **Scenarios launched** is the number of virtual users created
*   **Scenarios completed** is the number of virtual users that completed their scenarios
*   **Requests completed** is the number of HTTP requests and responses or WebSocket messages sent
*   **RPS sent** is the average number of requests per second completed
*   **Request latency** is in milliseconds, and p95 and p99 values are the 95th and 99th percentile values (a request latency p99 value of 500ms means that 99 out of 100 requests took 500ms or less to complete)
*   **Codes** provides the breakdown of HTTP response codes received

If you see NaN (“not a number”) reported as a value, that means not enough responses have been received to calculate the percentile.

If there are any errors(such as socket timeouts), those will be printed under Errors in the report as well.

Testing HTTP
------------

### HTTP-specific configuration

#### TLS/SSL

By default, Artillery will reject SSL certificates that it’s unable to validate, e.g. self-signed certificates. 
You may see errors such as `UNABLE_TO_GET_ISSUER_CERT_LOCALLY`, `UNABLE_TO_VERIFY_LEAF_SIGNATURE`, `CERT_UNTRUSTED` or one of the 
[other validation error codes](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/30219bfc572101f48d0bc4b01d04a5e22c1c4b74/src/node_crypto.cc#L2166) when 
that happens.

You can disable certificate validation with either of the following two options

1.  Pass `-k` (or `--insecure`) flat to `artillery run` or `artillery quick`
2.  Set `rejectUnauthorized: false` in `config.tls`:

    ```bash 
    config:
      target: "https://myapp.staging:3002"
      tls:
        rejectUnauthorized: false
    scenarios:
      - ...
    ```

    > Note: This option can be useful for testing in a development / staging environment, but should never be used when testing a production system.
